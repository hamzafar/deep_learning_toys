We have followed strategy to describe regression from simple to complex. i.e. we first discuss the regression concpet with small inputs and described all the equations and process in details. Then we generalized the concept and discussed how to use Regression with dynamic size input. The following two links (at Kaggle kernel) contains the simple and generic work respectively.
