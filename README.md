# Deep Learning Toys:

## Background:
Getting inspiation from #Andrew_Ng deep learning speccialization; **Heros of Deep Learning** I am compiling jupyter notebooks that focuses on the tips of the Heros. Below are main points; will be considering in this repo:

**1. Geofry Hinton:**
    Work on your own intiuation & code it
    
**2. Yoshua Bengio:**
    Create small deep learning toys
    
**3. Andrej Karpathy & Ian Good Fellow:**
    Deploy Algorithms from scratch
    
 
Compiling all tips together, we are making a toy that will understand Deep learning algorithms and deploy them from scratch. After then we will do some intuation in deep learning algorithms.  This Toy is really excited by new type of *Electricity* and really want to be an **Artificial Electrical Specialist**. Let's have toy story:
