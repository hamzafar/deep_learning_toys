# Deep Learning Toys:

## Background:
Getting inspiation from **Andrew_Ng** deep learning speccialization; **Heros of Deep Learning** I am compiling jupyter notebooks that focuses on the tips of the Heros. Below are main points; will be considering in this repo:

**1. Geofry Hinton:**
    Work on your own intiuation & code it
    
**2. Yoshua Bengio:**
    Create small deep learning toys
    
**3. Andrej Karpathy & Ian Good Fellow:**
    Deploy Algorithms from scratch
    
 
Compiling all tips together, we are making a toy that will understand Deep learning algorithms and deploy them from scratch. After then we will do some intuation in deep learning algorithms.  This Toy is really excited by new type of *Electricity* and really want to be an **Artificial Electrical Specialist**. Let's have toy story:

---

Alex has recently come to know about the new form of electricty that can transform the industrization. He is really excited to learn about it. So, he plans to build a basic circuit to start learning with that can replicate *XOR* gate but he is not using electric gate, instead he tries to implement this "new" concept in his knowledge. 

As Alex is new-bie in the field and he really does not know much about this field concepts but all he knows that there is tool Regression that can build *XOR* gate. So, he just picks up the tool and starts building his first basic *XOR* gate. His detailed demo of gate can be seen on the following link: [Make first gate](https://www.kaggle.com/hamzafar/derivation-in-context-of-logistic-regression)
